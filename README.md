# neorv32_mercury_carlson

NEORV32 RISC-V softcore for the MicroNova Mercury 2 (Artix-7).

This repository contains the FPGA side of the GAP NEORV32 stack. The Ada runtime and drivers are maintained separately and target the SoC configuration defined here.

## NEORV32 version

This repository currently uses **NEORV32 v1.13.6**.

The version is recorded in two places:

- `neorv32/` is a git submodule checked out at the corresponding tag.
- `NEORV32_VERSION` contains the expected tag. CI checks that the submodule matches it.

Software targeting this platform should use the NEORV32 sources included in this repository. In particular:

- SVD: `neorv32/sw/svd/neorv32.svd`
- Image generator: `neorv32/sw/image_gen/`

This keeps the hardware and software sides on the same NEORV32 version.

## SoC configuration

The SoC configuration is defined in `rtl/neorv32_mercury2_top.vhd`.

| `gpio_o[0..2]`                | M1, A14, A13 | user LEDs. LED 0 is the bootloader status LED  |

| `rstn_i`                      | C12          | FPGA-direct I/O 0, pulled up. Short to GND to reset |

The Mercury 2 module does not have a push button connected to this design, so reset is generated inside the FPGA at power-up.

To reset manually and return to the bootloader, briefly connect DIO 0 to GND.

## Get the sources

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/GNAT-Academic-Program/neorv32_mercury2.git
```

If the repository was cloned without `--recurse-submodules`:

```sh
git submodule update --init
```

## Build the bitstream

Building requires Vivado. The free edition supports both Mercury 2 FPGA sizes.

Vivado does not need to be on `PATH`; the build scripts look for an installed version automatically.

Prebuilt bitstreams are also attached to GitHub releases, so students do not need to build the FPGA image locally unless they want to modify the hardware.

Run the appropriate command from the root of the repository.

### Linux, 100T

```sh
./build.sh 100t
```

### Linux, 35T

```sh
./build.sh 35t
```

### Windows, 100T

```bat
build.bat 100t
```

### Windows, 35T

```bat
build.bat 35t
```

The generated bitstream is:

```text
vivado/mercury2/neorv32_mercury2_100t.bit
```

or:

```text
vivado/mercury2/neorv32_mercury2_35t.bit
```

The FPGA size must be specified because the two Mercury 2 variants use different bitstreams.

### If Vivado is not found

If Vivado is installed in a location the script does not detect, set `VIVADO` to the launcher path before running the build.

Linux:

```sh
export VIVADO=/tools/Xilinx/2026.1/Vivado/bin/vivado
```

Windows:

```bat
set VIVADO=C:\Vivado\2026.1\Vivado\bin\vivado.bat
```

On Windows, point `VIVADO` to `bin\vivado.bat`.

The `vivado.exe` under `bin\unwrapped` is not the normal launcher and may fail because required runtime DLLs are not set up.

## Load the bitstream on the board

Connect the Mercury 2 with its USB cable, then run the appropriate command from the root of the repository.

The examples below use the 35T bitstream. For a 100T board, replace the filename with `neorv32_mercury2_100t.bit`.

### Windows

Works from both PowerShell and `cmd`:

```bat
.\flash\flash.bat vivado\mercury2\neorv32_mercury2_35t.bit
```

### Linux

```sh
sh flash/flash.sh vivado/mercury2/neorv32_mercury2_35t.bit
```

The Linux programmer uses `sudo` to access the board and may ask for your password.

### Expected output

The programmer should report `Found flash`, show progress up to 100%, and then print the programming time.

Programming can take up to about a minute.

The bitstream is written to the board's flash memory, so the FPGA loads it again after power is removed and restored.

### Using a prebuilt bitstream

If you downloaded a bitstream from a GitHub release, save it locally and pass that file directly to the flash script.

Windows:

```bat
.\flash\flash.bat neorv32_mercury2_35t.bit
```

Linux:

```sh
sh flash/flash.sh neorv32_mercury2_35t.bit
```

### Troubleshooting

If Windows reports:

```text
FTDI driver is not installed
```

install the FTDI D2XX/CDM driver from:

https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/

Then unplug and reconnect the board before trying again.

If the programmer reports:

```text
No Mercury 2 FPGA board found
```

check the USB connection and make sure another application is not using the board, such as Vivado Hardware Manager or a serial terminal connected to the relevant FTDI interface.

On Linux, the programmer temporarily unloads the FTDI serial driver while writing the flash. Other FTDI serial ports on the machine may therefore disappear for a few seconds and return when programming completes.

### Programmer

`flash/mercury2_prog.exe` and `flash/mercury2_prog` are unmodified binaries from:

https://github.com/micro-nova/mercury2_prog

They correspond to commit `fb3118b`.

## Serial console

The console scripts automatically locate the board's serial port and open it at **19200 8N1**.

No additional serial terminal software is required.

Run the command from the root of the repository. Press **Escape** to quit.

### Windows

Works from both PowerShell and `cmd`:

```bat
.\console\console.bat
```

### Linux

```sh
bash console/console.sh
```

### Troubleshooting

If Windows reports:

```text
the board is plugged in but has no serial port
```

Windows may need to be configured once to expose FT2232H channel B as a virtual COM port:

1. Open Device Manager.
2. Open **Universal Serial Bus controllers**.
3. Double-click **USB Serial Converter B**.
4. Open the **Advanced** tab.
5. Enable **Load VCP**.
6. Click OK.
7. Unplug and reconnect the board.
8. Run the console again.

If Windows reports:

```text
the board is not seen by Windows
```

check that the board is connected.

When using a virtual machine, the USB device may also need to be attached to the VM again after the board is unplugged or reconnected.

If Linux reports a permission error, the console script prints the equivalent command using `sudo`.

If more than one compatible board is detected, the script prints the available ports and the command to select one explicitly.

## First boot

1. Load the bitstream onto the board.
2. LED 0 should blink roughly twice per second while the bootloader is running.
3. Open the serial console.
4. Press `r` to restart the bootloader. It should print `NEORV32 Bootloader` and begin an 8-second countdown.
5. Press any key to stop the countdown and reach the `CMD:>` prompt.
6. Press `i` to display the system information.

The `HWV` line should report:

```text
0x01130600
```

This corresponds to NEORV32 v1.13.6.

If LED 0 remains continuously on instead of blinking, the bootloader has likely stopped before reaching its normal loop.

## Simulation

Simulation currently runs on Linux. On Windows, WSL can be used.

GHDL is required.

```sh
./sim/run.sh
```

The test boots the Mercury 2 top-level design in GHDL and checks that the NEORV32 bootloader banner is emitted through UART0.

A complete simulation takes about three minutes.

CI runs the same test on every push.

## Updating NEORV32

When moving this platform to a newer NEORV32 release:

1. Update the submodule:

   ```sh
   git -C neorv32 fetch --tags
   git -C neorv32 checkout <new tag>
   ```

2. Update `NEORV32_VERSION`.

3. Update the version documented in this README.

4. Run:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/check_pin.sh
   ./sim/run.sh
   ```

5. Rebuild the bitstream and test it on the board.

6. Publish a new release once the hardware configuration has been validated.

The shell commands above can be run from Git Bash or WSL on Windows.

The software side should then regenerate its register definitions from the updated SVD and update the expected `mimpid` value.

## Repository layout

```text

rtl/neorv32_mercury2_top.vhd   board top and SoC configuration

sim/                            GHDL smoke test
scripts/check_pin.sh            NEORV32 version check
```

The repository layout follows the general structure used by
[neorv32-setups](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32-setups): the same submodule name and location, the same board-directory depth, and compatible top-level port naming.

This should also make it straightforward to contribute the Mercury 2 setup upstream later if desired.
